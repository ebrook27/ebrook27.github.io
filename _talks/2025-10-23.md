**Title**:  
Spatiotemporal Modeling of Opioid Mortality Risk: The Role of Urbanicity and Social Vulnerability

**Abstract**:  
The opioid crisis continues to be one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States. Despite strong reductions in prescription rates during the 2010s, opioid overdose deaths rose substantially in that time. In order to develop effective policy intervention strategies, researchers must have a firm understanding of both the socioeconomic and spatiotemporal determinants of the crisis, and utilize these to determine which regions of the US are most at risk of opioid overdose mortality.
Our work begins by analyzing the relationship between urbanicity level, mortality, and socioeconomic factors to identify patterns in the landscape of risk. We also develop a novel risk methodology for use with machine learning models to determine where mortality hotspots and coldspots form.
