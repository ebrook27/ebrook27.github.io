I’m **Eli Brooks**, a PhD candidate focused on **applied data science and machine learning**, with a particular interest in public health applications. My work sits at the intersection of mathematics, data science, and policy-relevant analysis, with an emphasis on interpretable models and decision-oriented outputs.

I build end-to-end modeling workflows for the opioid crisis, spanning data acquisition and ETL, county-level forecasting and risk modeling, evaluation and diagnostics, and scenario-based analyses that translate model output into actionable insights.

### What I work on
- **Public health analytics:** county-level modeling of opioid overdose mortality, longitudinal risk stratification, and counterfactual policy simulations targeting prescribing practices and social determinants of health.
  
- **Advanced manufacturing analytics:** time-series and state-space modeling (e.g., EKF-style approaches) for real-time temperature prediction and process monitoring in additive manufacturing.

### What you’ll find here
- **Projects:** case-study style writeups linking to code, results, and technical notes.
- **Talks:** selected presentations and talks.
- **CV:** A brief overview of my education, talks, and experience
 
[- **Blog (optional):** shorter writeups on modeling choices, diagnostics, and reproducible workflows.]: #
