I’m **Eli Brooks**, a PhD candidate focused on **applied data science and machine learning**. I build end-to-end modeling workflows: data acquisition and ETL, forecasting and risk modeling, evaluation and diagnostics, and scenario-based analyses that translate model output into decisions.

### What I work on
- **Public health analytics:** county-level modeling of opioid overdose mortality, risk stratification, and counterfactual policy simulations (e.g., prescribing, insurance coverage, unemployment).
  
[- **Advanced manufacturing analytics:** time-series and state-space modeling (e.g., EKF-style approaches) for real-time temperature prediction and process monitoring in additive manufacturing.]: #

### What you’ll find here
- **Projects:** case-study style writeups linking to code, results, and technical notes.
- **Talks:** selected presentations and talks.
 
[- **Blog (optional):** shorter writeups on modeling choices, diagnostics, and reproducible workflows.]: #

If you’re hiring for **Data Scientist / ML Engineer / Applied Scientist** roles (or want to collaborate), the fastest way to reach me is via **LinkedIn** or **email**.
